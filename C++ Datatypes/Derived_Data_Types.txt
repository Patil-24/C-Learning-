The data-types that are derived from the primitive or built-in datatypes are referred to as Derived Data Types. These can be of four types namely:

Function
Array
Pointers
References
Let’s briefly understand each of the following derived datatypes:

Function: A function is a block of code or program-segment that is defined to perform a specific well-defined task. A function is generally defined to save the user from writing the same lines of code again and again for the same input. All the lines of code are put together inside a single function and this can be called anywhere required. main() is a default function that is defined in every program of C++.
Syntax:

FunctionType FunctionName(parameters)


Array: An array is a collection of items stored at continuous memory locations. The idea of array is to represent many instances in one variable.

DataType ArrayName[size_of_array];


Pointers: Pointers are symbolic representation of addresses. They enable programs to simulate call-by-reference as well as to create and manipulate dynamic data structures. It’s general declaration in C/C++ has the format:
Syntax:

datatype *var_name;


Reference: When a variable is declared as reference, it becomes an alternative name for an existing variable. A variable can be declared as reference by putting ‘&’ in the declaration.
